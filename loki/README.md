# Loki

This is the Loki configuration file.

It runs on port `3100` which is the default. It defines filesystem backends rather than S3 or any of the more large-scale distributed databases for simplicity.

There's not much more to say about this, the official documentation is [here](https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/master/docs/README.md).
